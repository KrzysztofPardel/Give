## **Description**

#### Give,as you might expect is all about giving! What does that mean?

When we look around in our country, we can see that over the last 20 years, a major development has taken place. The average John Smith can live on a higher standard and can afford more than ever before. However, that's not everyone's story.

In proportion to the minimal wage, the prices have gone up signifiacntly and made life harder for some who were already destitude. There are single moders or whole families who struggle to make end meet on monthly basis.

Give helps in aiding those who are in need. The purspose of this website is to mediate between people who are willing to donate and the ones who are willing to receive. Various resources, such as books, fabric materials, clothes do not need to be thrown away the moment you don't need them. They can be passed to someone else. Did you know that?

**_So do not be indifferent toward those who were less fortunate than you. Get involved today._**
